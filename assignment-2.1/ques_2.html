    <h1>Html entities</h1>
    <p>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).
        Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
        and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are
        difficult to type with a standard keyboard
