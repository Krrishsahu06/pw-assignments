    <h1>Web accessibility</h1>
    <p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with
        disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:
    <ul>
        <li>perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web</li>
        <li>contribute to the Web</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
